# Gota's Sequence Library
A platform-agnostic library for interpreting and playing sequence data for NintendoWare sequences. The bulk of the player code was made by Kermalis.

## Dependencies
Note, this library depends on my Sound/IO library which you can find here: https://github.com/Gota7/GotaSoundIO
